# darkThreading
Platform agnostic light-locking threading library for Delphi.

darkThreading has been extracted from the darkGlass project https://github.com/chapmanworld/DarkGlass and is not currently ready for use as an independent project. This project is pending an overhaul as part of the on-going darkGlass development.
